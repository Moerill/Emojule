# v0.2.0

- *NEW* Custom emoji support!
- Updated emoji list to support the newest unicode standard!
- Suggestions is now shown for partial matches inside of the code words as well!
- Now using ``PNG`` files instead of ``SVG`` to reduce space used. The old svg files remain until some time in the future (latest 1.0.0) to support backwards compatibility. At that point old messages are probably far enough back in the chat log to not matter anymore.
- Restructured data and some code to massively decrease memory usage and increase performance

# v0.1.2

- Fix wrong paths remaining after module renaming

# v0.1.0

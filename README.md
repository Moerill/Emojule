This module adds Emoji/Emoticon/Smiley support to chat and most text based editors in FVTT. It also provides suggestions for emojis in chat. Just start your emoji using ``:`` and suggestions will appear! (Suggestions is only available for chat.)  
The emojis are encoded similar to most modern apps, like Discord, using ':keyword:', e.g. ':smile:'.  
Use the settings menu to add your own custom emojis!
